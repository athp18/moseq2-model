## Documentation

MoSeq2 uses `sphinx` to generate the documentation in HTML and PDF forms. To install `sphinx`, follow the commands below:
```.bash
pip install sphinx==3.0.3 sphinx_click==2.5.0
pip install sphinx-rtd-theme
pip install rst2pdf
``` 

All documentation regarding moseq2-extract can be found in the `Documentation.pdf` file in the root directory,
an HTML ReadTheDocs page can be generated via running the `make html` in the `docs/` directory.

To generate a PDF version of the documentation, simply run `make pdf` in the `docs/` directory.

## Prerequisites

To use this package, you must have already generated a `pca_scores.h5` file and an index file `moseq2-index.yaml` containing all of your
session metadata (specifically data groupings).
 - The index file is generated when aggregating the results in [moseq2-extract](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-extract/tree/release) 
 - The pca_scores are generated via [moseq2-pca](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-pca/tree/release).
